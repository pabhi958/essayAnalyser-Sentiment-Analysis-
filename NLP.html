      <h3>1st Essay</h3>
      <p>
        Almost all of us have many types of wishes and we sincerely wish that our wishes came true.
        When I was very small, my mom used to say to write down the wishes and keep it somewhere hiding, so the fairies could see and grant my wishes.
        And so I used to do it and most of it were being granted.
        It was later only I realized that it was my mom who made my wishes come true.
        Now when I am a bit more older, I have a few wishes in me, which I would love to get fulfilled at some point of time.
        My first wish is to be in the cockpit of an airplane and ride the airplane for some time !! Wow..does not that sound great.
        I have watched in the television about the cockpit detail and how efficiently they manage it.
        Though I know that you need to study a lot about it, atleast I would like to see how it works.
        I really liked the inside of the cockpit when I saw it in the television. My father said to me he will try. I hope one day I would be able to fulfill my dream.
        My second wish is to write a book when I get big. I love reading and I read a lot of books.
        Each time I read a book, even I think I should be writing something valuable for others to read.
        There are so many things of what I could write, but I prefer to write detective novels.
        They are so interesting and thrilling that the readers would love to keep them excited throughout the book.
        I hope one day I would be able to write a good detective novel and be able to sell my books.
        At last not the least, I have another wish too, to be a Chef!!! I always see my mom preparing all that lovely food for us.
        It is an art to prepare great and delicious food and present it well. I help my mom sometimes and I love cooking. I hope one day I would become a great Chef.
        Simple wishes in life, but I believe when we wish sincerely, it would become true and I sincerely hold to my three wishes and hope to get it true.

      <h3>2nd Essay</h3>
      <p>
        I have many wishes. I pray that some of them may come true. out of all the wishes, three are most important for me.
        My first wish is to have a pencil that will turn everything that I draw, into real things.
        I would make so many things with that pencil. I would make chocolate and new clothes whenever I want and I would wear new clothes every day.
        I would make a bicycle and a lot of toys. I would also ask other people what they want and I would draw those things and give it to them.
        My second wish is to fly like a bird. I love birds because they can fly when they want and they go wherever they want to go.
        Birds are free to fly and they are not like Aeroplanes and Kites. These things fly for only some time. Birds are independent.
        My favourite is the Eagle bird. It can fly very high in the sky. I wish I could become like it so that I could travel the whole world.
        I would see my city from above. I would love to fly in the clouds. There would be no noise there.
        My third wish is to help poor people. I wish I could get lots of money in a big bag one day.
        I would take the money and give it to the poor people who ask for money on the roads. I would buy clothes and food for them.
        I would buy toys for children and they would play with them. They will be very happy and their parents will not be sad anymore.
        My mother says that If I will study well, I would make them come true in some ways in my future.

      <h3>3rd Essay</h3>
      <p>
        People have a lot of wishes in their life. As a human, I have my own wish. My wishes can be about the past, the present and the future.
        After many years, I have realized that I cannot change the past or even the present; but I can change my future.
        My wishes for the future life are being successful in career, having a happy life and working as an animal protector.
        To be successful in career, I can earn a lot of money to improve my living condition.
        Besides that, I will get the respect from colleagues because of my excellent achievements.
        And I will not worry about being unemployed if a lay-off occurs.
        It is lucky to have a happy life. I will do whatever I want, travel to many beautiful places to make friend with other people and learn about interesting things in the world.
        My future life will be full of pleasure and positive thinking.
        The reason why I want to be an animal protector in the future is that I would save many animals from being abused or being killed.
        It is my hope to see people around me treating well with animals. They should be treated as humans' best friends for everything that they have contributed to human.
        In summary, although I have a lot of wishes throughout my younger life, but I really want to succeed in career, live happily and work as an animal protector in the future.
        And I will try my best to achieve these wishes instead of waiting for a miracle.

        So I am trying control myself and achieve my first dream. My second wish is to become a football player and play for the country.

      <p>
        When I get bigger, Big enough to go somewhere by myself. I wanna go somewhere far away
        from here. I wanna go to an island, An Island without any people. An Island that does not know
        any pain or sadness on it either. There are no grown ups, kids, classmates, teachers. Even my
        mom isn't there.A place where no one will hit me for no reason, a place where I can eat
        whenever I want it, When I feel like I wanna climb the tree, I can climb it, I go swimming if I want
        to and sleep when I want to.
        On the Island, I will think about what’s going on in the town without me. Kids go to school like
        nothing’s changed, Grown up’s go to work like nothing’s changed. Mom makes her dinner like
        nothing’s changed and when I think about town without me I feel relief more than anything.
        All I want is to go far away.
